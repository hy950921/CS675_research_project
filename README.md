## λQuiver: Adapting InfiniCache to support deep learning training applications:

  Having InfiniCache to only serve web applications’ I/O workloads is far from enough. In this project, you’ll explore an interesting and potentially compelling use case of InfiniCache -- adapting InfiniCache to cache the I/O workloads of deep learning training applications. You’ll build λQuiver, an informed storage cache for deep learning training applications, which will be built atop Lambda-boosted InfiniCache. This will be a fun exploration of a complex system of some kind.
